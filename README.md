# B2B Sales Analytics Project 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end‑to‑end **data analytics case study** focused on understanding **sales performance, discount behavior, and business stability** using a modern analytics stack.

The workflow follows a real‑world analytics pipeline:
**Data generation → Data cleaning → Exploratory analysis → Business intelligence reporting**.

The final outcome is an **interactive Power BI report** designed for business stakeholders.

## 🧩 Data Collection

### 🔹 Synthetic Data Generation (Python)

* A **Python script** was used to generate a **dirty transactional dataset**.
* The dataset simulates a real e‑commerce environment with:

  * **800,000+ rows** of sales transactions
  * Intentional data quality issues such as:

    * Missing values
    * Inconsistent formats
    * Duplicate records
    * Noisy categorical fields

### 🔹 Core Tables Created

* **Sales** (transaction‑level data)
* **Customers**
* **Products**
* **Stores**

The data was generated to closely resemble **production‑scale business data**.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 🔹 Tools Used

* **Python (Jupyter Notebook – .ipynb)**
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy

### 🔹 Cleaning Activities Performed

* Handling missing and null values
* Removing duplicate records
* Standardizing column formats
* Validating numerical ranges (price, quantity, discount)
* Ensuring referential integrity between tables
* Creating derived fields required for analysis

📌 The complete data cleaning logic is documented in the **attached Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Tool Used

* **SQL (SQL Server)**

### 🔹 EDA Objectives

* Understand sales distribution and trends
* Identify high‑discount and low‑margin areas
* Validate data consistency post‑cleaning
* Analyze customer, product, and regional behavior

### 🔹 Key SQL Analyses

* Revenue and profit trends
* Discount contribution analysis
* Category and region‑level aggregation
* Outlier detection in sales and discounts

EDA results were used to **shape KPIs and visuals** in the Power BI report.

## 📈 Power BI Reporting

### 🔹 Data Model

* **Star Schema** with Sales as the fact table
* Dimension tables:

  * Customers
  * Products
  * Stores
  * Calendar (marked as Date Table)

## ❓ Business Questions Addressed

1. **Are discounts effectively increasing sales volume, or are they eroding profit?**
2. **Which products contribute most to discount leakage (80/20 analysis)?**
3. **How does discount behavior vary across regions and customer segments?**
4. **Is the business maintaining healthy margins after applying discounts?**

Each question is answered through a combination of **KPIs, trend analysis, and visual storytelling**.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### 📌 Business Status

Based on the analysis:

* Revenue and profit trends show **consistent growth**
* Discounting is controlled and mostly effective
* No major structural risks were identified

### 🚀 Strategic Recommendation

**The business is stable and well‑positioned for expansion.**

Suggested next steps:

* Gradual expansion into new regions
* Optimizing discounts for high‑impact products
* Strengthening pricing strategies for low‑margin categories
* Leveraging data‑driven promotions instead of blanket discounting
